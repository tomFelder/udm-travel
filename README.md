### Ignore the following notes ;)
This is a project bring completed for a Udemy course. So far so good!

I've just started the javascript section but need more time to complete it!

Time seems to be disappearing on me. I'm going to get cracking again soon.

Looking forward to getting back into this... tomorrow maybe? Hopefully tomorrow!

Almost getting frustrated with how long I've been out on this. Going to go for it tomorrow... Tuesday at the latest.

Back into it now and enjoying it. However I do have an issue with JS and webpack

Really enjoying this but find myself exhausted every night... need to find a way to work it into my days

Finally got back into this yesterday and really enjoyed it! I really need to force myself to take the time.
